/**
 * \function igraph_establishment_game
 * \brief Generates a graph with a simple growing model with vertex types.
 *
 * </para><para>
 * The simulation goes like this: a single vertex is added at each
 * time step. This new vertex tries to connect to \p k vertices in the
 * graph. The probability that such a connection is realized depends
 * on the types of the vertices involved.
 *
 * \param graph Pointer to an uninitialized graph.
 * \param nodes The number of vertices in the graph.
 * \param types The number of vertex types.
 * \param k The number of connections tried in each time step.
 * \param type_dist Vector giving the distribution of vertex types.
 * \param pref_matrix Matrix giving the connection probabilities for
 * different vertex types.
 * \param directed Logical, whether to generate a directed graph.
 * \return Error code.
 *
 * Added in version 0.2.</para><para>
 *
 * Time complexity: O(|V|*k*log(|V|)), |V| is the number of vertices
 * and k is the \p k parameter.
